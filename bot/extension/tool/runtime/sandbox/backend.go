// Profile describes the sandbox environment for a command.
//
// A zero-value Profile (with only Workspace set) requests the strictest
// write-capable profile. The native backend isolates networking and /tmp and
// limits the filesystem view; reduced-isolation fallbacks may only enforce
// which paths are writable.
//
// Fields opened by capability grants incrementally relax isolation without
// leaving the sandbox:
//
//   - Network: authorize network use (the native backend shares the host
//     network namespace; a reduced fallback may already lack isolation).
//   - WritePaths: extra host directories bind-mounted as read-write.
//
// The sandbox package does NOT enforce a whitelist on WritePaths — the
// calling layer is responsible for authorization. Paths may use ~/ prefixes
// (resolved to the user's home) and are cleaned + deduplicated internally.
//
// This is a type alias to impl.Profile (defined in the impl subpackage) so
// the public sandbox package exposes the same struct callers use, while the
// canonical definition lives with the implementations.

// UnavailableError is returned when no sandbox backend could be used.
// Callers should treat it as a signal to request host-execution permission.

// This is a type alias to impl.UnavailableError so that the public sandbox
// package exposes the same error type callers match on, while the canonical
// definition lives with the implementations.
